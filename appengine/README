This component runs on Google App Engine. It reflects domain-fronted
requests from a client to the Snowflake broker.

You need the Go App Engine SDK in order to deploy the app.
	https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/#linux
After unpacking, install the app-engine-go component:
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud components install app-engine-go

To test locally, run
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/dev_appserver.py app.yaml
The app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

To deploy to App Engine, first create a new project and app. You have to
think of a unique name (marked as "<appname>" in the commands). You only
have to do the "create" step once; subsequent times you can go straight
to the "deploy" step. This command will open a browser window so you can
log in to a Google account.
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud projects create <appname>
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud app create --project=<appname>
Then to deploy the project, run:
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud app deploy --project=<appname>

To configure the Snowflake client to talk to the App Engine app, provide
"https://<appname>.appspot.com/" as the --url option.
